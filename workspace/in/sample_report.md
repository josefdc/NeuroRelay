# Sample Project Report

## Executive Summary
This project aims to develop an innovative brain-computer interface system using SSVEP technology. The main objectives are to create a real-time, offline system that can detect user intentions with high accuracy.

## Key Deliverables
- Complete 4-option SSVEP detection system
- Local agent integration with LM Studio
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Documentation and user guides

## Timeline
- Phase 1: UI development (complete by Sept 15)
- Phase 2: Signal processing (complete by Sept 20) 
- Phase 3: Live integration (complete by Sept 25)
- Phase 4: Agent tools (due October 1)

## Action Items
- Finalize the frequency selection algorithm
- Test with multiple users for validation
- Prepare demo materials for presentation
- Submit final deliverables by October 5

## Budget Considerations
Total project cost estimated at $45,000, with most expenses in hardware and software licensing.

## Next Steps
We need to schedule user testing sessions next week and prepare the demonstration setup.
Contact @alice for hardware setup and @bob for software testing.

## Deadlines
